# opinion
A template for documenting and updating one's own public opinions with git.

## Idea
`civngage/opinion` is an attempt to have deeper conversations about things that really matter to us. The idea is to share a relatively simple template that anyone can use to express their own opinions. However, unlike social media platforms which can degrade into a mess of fleeting reactions and counter reactions, `civngage/opinion` is a central place for an individual to express their core values, beliefs and opinions while also revising them over time.

## "Secret" agenda
### Problems
I got this idea when I was thinking about how we* expect our politicians to respond to reason and argument, but if they change their mind too much, we call them a flip-flopper. We want them to be able to answer any question, but we're mad when they get basic things wrong or come off arrogant. We want them to be honest out in the open about their policies, but we also schedule them for private events to make promises to each of our special interest groups.

### Goals
I hope that we can create a platform that allows politicians to express their views and policies as evolving over time in response to their constituents and competitors and hopefully in response to reason. I hope this platform also allows them to highlight what they feel most strongly about, demonstrate their reasoning, and acknowledge what they don't know about. I hope it forces them to express their positions in one public place without spinning it for different audiences and of course forces them to rationalize their choices, so that it's easier to hold them accountable.

### Why git?
I think git accomplishes these goals because it allows users to make changes while automatically tracking those changes in a public and accountable way. It also offers parallel "branches" to experiment, discuss, and develop new ideas or enhancements and deliberate before overwriting the "official" branch (master). So, for the git geeks out there, I image a politician debating with their constituents about whether a pull request is ready to merge.

\*When I say "we", I'm referring to Americans.

## How-to
### Prerequisites
You don't have to be an expert in all these tools, but some idea and practice with them will help:
- Markdown (esp. github flavored)
- git
- github (which I like to call facebook for git)
- github pages (to host your repo as a website)
- jekyll (to give your website a visual theme)

### Steps
These steps should be enough if you have the prerequisites, but I'll come back and revise them for beginners:
- fork this repository to your personal github account
- check out the folders under `/src`, which are arranged by topic
- start adding markdown files under topics that interest you
- you should be able to see your site at: `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/opinion/`
- for example, the template is at: https://civngage.github.io/opinion/
